msgid "Using a macro as a an l-value"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0674.rst:32
msgid ""
"In the Python C API, some functions are implemented as macro because "
"writing a macro is simpler than writing a regular function. If a macro "
"exposes directly a structure member, it is technically possible to use "
"this macro to not only get the structure member but also set it."

"Setting directly an object attribute relies on the current exact CPython "

msgid ""
"Sam Gross forked Python 3.9 to remove the GIL: the `nogil branch "
"<https://github.com/colesbury/nogil/>`_. This fork has no "
"``PyObject.ob_refcnt`` member, but a more elaborated implementation for "
"reference counting, and so the ``Py_REFCNT(obj) = new_refcnt;`` code "
"fails with a compiler error."

"Searching and replacing ``Py_SET_SIZE()`` is easier and safer than "
"searching and replacing some strange macro uses of ``Py_SIZE()``. "
"``Py_SIZE()`` can be semi-mechanically replaced by ``HPy_Length()``, "
"whereas seeing ``Py_SET_SIZE()`` would immediately make clear that the "

"In GraalVM, when a Python object is accessed by the Python C API, the C "
"API emulation layer has to wrap the GraalVM objects into wrappers that "
"expose the internal structure of the CPython structures (PyObject, "
"PyLongObject, PyTypeObject, etc). This is because when the C code "
"accesses it directly or via macros, all GraalVM can intercept is a read "
"at the struct offset, which has to be mapped back to the representation "
"in GraalVM. The smaller the \"effective\" number of exposed struct "
"members (by replacing macros with functions), the simpler GraalVM "
"wrappers can be."
