":pep:`484` introduced type hinting to Python, with goals of making typing"
" gradual and easy to adopt. Currently, typing information must be "
"distributed manually. This PEP provides a standardized means to leverage "
"existing tooling to package and distribute type information with minimal "
"work and an ordering for type checkers to resolve modules and collect "
"this information for type checking."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0561.rst:27
msgid ""
"Currently, package authors wish to distribute code that has inline type "
"information. Additionally, maintainers would like to distribute stub "
"files to keep Python 2 compatibility while using newer annotation syntax."
" However, there is no standard method to distribute packages with type "
"information. Also, if one wished to ship stub files privately the only "
"method available would be via setting ``MYPYPATH`` or the equivalent to "
"manually point to stubs. If the package can be released publicly, it can "
"be added to typeshed [1]_. However, this does not scale and becomes a "
"burden on the maintainers of typeshed. In addition, it ties bug fixes in "
"stubs to releases of the tool using typeshed."

":pep:`484` has a brief section on distributing typing information. In "
"this :pep:`section <484#storing-and-distributing-stub-files>` the PEP "
"recommends using ``shared/typehints/pythonX.Y/`` for shipping stub files."
" However, manually adding a path to stub files for each third party "
"library does not scale. The simplest approach people have taken is to add"
" ``site-packages`` to their ``MYPYPATH``, but this causes type checkers "
"to fail on packages that are highly dynamic (e.g. sqlalchemy and Django)."

"The two major parts of this specification are the packaging "

"Package maintainers who wish to support type checking of their code MUST "
"add a marker file named ``py.typed`` to their package supporting typing. "
"This marker applies recursively: if a top-level package includes it, all "

"be put in a separate package and distributed separately. Third parties "
"can also find this method useful if they wish to distribute stub files. "
"The name of the stub package MUST follow the scheme ``foopkg-stubs`` for "
"type stubs for the package named ``foopkg``. Note that for stub-only "
"packages adding a ``py.typed`` marker is not needed since the name "
"``*-stubs`` is enough to indicate it is a source of typing information."

"Third parties seeking to distribute stub files are encouraged to contact "

" information inline, then a third party stub-only package can be created."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0561.rst:152
msgid ""
"In addition, stub-only distributions SHOULD indicate which version(s) of "
"the runtime package are supported by indicating the runtime "
"distribution's version(s) through normal dependency data. For example, "
"the stub package ``flyingcircus-stubs`` can indicate the versions of the "
"runtime ``flyingcircus`` distribution it supports through "
"``install_requires`` in distutils-based tools, or the equivalent in other"
" packaging tools. Note that in pip 9.0, if you update ``flyingcircus-"
