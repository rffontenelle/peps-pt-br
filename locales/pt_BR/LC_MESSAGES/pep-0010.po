"This PEP outlines the python-dev voting guidelines.  These guidelines serve "
"to provide feedback or gauge the \"wind direction\" on a particular "
"proposal, idea, or feature.  They don't have a binding force."

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0010.txt:24
msgid ""
"When a new idea, feature, patch, etc. is floated in the Python community, "
"either through a PEP or on the mailing lists (most likely on python-dev "
"[1]_), it is sometimes helpful to gauge the community's general sentiment.  "
"Sometimes people just want to register their opinion of an idea.  Sometimes "
"the BDFL wants to take a straw poll. Whatever the reason, these guidelines "
"have been adopted so as to provide a common language for developers."

#: ../pep-0010.txt:32
msgid ""
"While opinions are (sometimes) useful, but they are never binding. Opinions "
"that are accompanied by rationales are always valued higher than bare scores "
"(this is especially true with -1 votes)."

"The scoring guidelines are loosely derived from the Apache voting procedure "

"scores:"

"You may occasionally see wild flashes of enthusiasm (either for or against) "
"with vote scores like +2, +1000, or -1000.  These aren't really valued much "
"beyond the above scores, but it's nice to see people get excited about such "
"geeky stuff."
