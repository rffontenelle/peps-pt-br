"After unprecedented community response (very good arguments were made "

"Some find that any form of punctuation makes the language more cryptic.  "

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0308.txt:257
msgid ""
"Adapting existing keywords attempts to improve on punctuation through "
"explicit meaning and a more tidy appearance.  The downside is some loss "
"of the economy-of-expression provided by punctuation operators.  The "
"other downside is that it creates some degree of confusion between the "
"two meanings and two usages of the keywords."
msgstr ""

"The last position is doing nothing.  Arguments in favor include keeping "
"the language simple and concise; maintaining backwards compatibility; and"

"\"if\" and \"else\".  Lambda expressions are an exception as they require"
" the conditional to be factored out into a separate function definition."
msgstr ""

"contained expressions that could be helped by ``cond()`` or a ternary "
"operator; and that most of those had no need for short-circuit "

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0308.txt:317
msgid ""
"A counterpoint to that analysis is that the availability of a ternary "
"operator helped the programmer in every case because it spared the need "
