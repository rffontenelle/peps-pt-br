"This PEP proposes the creation of a ``manylinux2010`` platform tag to "

"True to its name, the ``manylinux1`` platform tag has made the "
"installation of binary extension modules a reality on many Linux systems."

"``manylinux1`` wheels achieve their portability by allowing the extension"
" modules they contain to link against only a small set of system-level "
"shared libraries that export versioned symbols old enough to benefit from"
" backwards-compatibility policies.  Extension modules in a ``manylinux1``"
" wheel that rely on ``glibc``, for example, must be built against version"
" 2.5 or earlier; they may then be run systems that provide more recent "
"``glibc`` version that still export the required symbols at version 2.5."

":pep:`513` drew its whitelisted shared libraries and their symbol "
"versions from CentOS 5.11, which was the oldest supported CentOS release "
"at the time of its writing.  Unfortunately, CentOS 5.11 reached its end-"
"of-life on March 31st, 2017 with a clear warning against its continued "
"use. [4]_ No further updates, such as security patches, will be made "

"``manylinux1`` Docker image."

"CentOS 6 is now the oldest supported CentOS release, and will receive "

"This was originally proposed as ``manylinux2``, but the versioning has "
