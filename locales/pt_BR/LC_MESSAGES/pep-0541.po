msgid ""
"This PEP proposes an extension to the Terms of Use [1]_ of the Package Index "
"[2]_, clarifying expectations of package owners regarding ownership of a "
"package name on the Package Index, specifically with regards to conflict "
"resolution."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0541.txt:25

#: ../pep-0541.txt:30
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0541.txt:32
msgid ""
"Given that package names on the Index are sharing a single flat namespace, a "
"unique name is a finite resource.  The growing age of the Package Index "
"causes a constant rise of situations of conflict between the current use of "
"the name and a different suggested use of the same name."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0541.txt:38

"typical cases of such conflicts."

msgid "Approval Process"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0541.txt:45
msgid ""
"As the application of this policy has potential legal ramifications for the "
"Python Software Foundation, the approval process used is more formal than "
"that used for most PEPs."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0541.txt:49
msgid ""
"Rather than accepting the PEP directly, the assigned BDFL-Delegate will "
"instead recommend its acceptance to the PSF's Packaging Working Group. After "
"consultation with the PSF's General Counsel, adoption of the policy will "
"then be subject to a formal vote within the working group."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0541.txt:54

"This formal approval process will be used for both initial adoption of the "
"policy, and for adoption of any future amendments."

#: ../pep-0541.txt:59
msgid "Specification"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0541.txt:61
msgid ""
"The main idea behind this document is that the Package Index serves the "
"community.  Every user is invited to upload content to the Package Index "
"under the Terms of Use, understanding that it is at the sole risk of the "
"user."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0541.txt:66
msgid ""
"While the Package Index is not a backup service, the maintainers of the "
"Package Index do their best to keep that content accessible indefinitely in "
"its published form.  However, in certain edge cases the greater community's "
"needs might overweigh the individual's expectation of ownership of a package "
"name."
