"decorators introduced in :pep:`318`."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-3129.txt:24
msgid ""
"When function decorators were originally debated for inclusion in Python "
"2.4, class decorators were seen as :pep:`obscure and unnecessary "
"<318#motivation>` thanks to metaclasses.  After several years' experience "
"with the Python 2.4.x series of releases and an increasing familiarity with "
"function decorators and their uses, the BDFL and the community re-evaluated "
"class decorators and recommended their inclusion in Python 3.0 [#approval]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-3129.txt:33
msgid ""
"The motivating use-case was to make certain constructs more easily expressed "
"and less reliant on implementation details of the CPython interpreter.  "
"While it is possible to express class decorator-like functionality using "
"metaclasses, the results are generally unpleasant and the implementation "
"highly fragile [#motivation]_.  In addition, metaclasses are inherited, "
"whereas class decorators are not, making metaclasses unsuitable for some, "
"single class-specific uses of class decorators. The fact that large-scale "
"Python projects like Zope were going through these wild contortions to "
"achieve something like class decorators won over the BDFL."

msgid "Semantics"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-3129.txt:48
msgid ""
"The semantics and design goals of class decorators are the same as for "
"function decorators (:pep:`318#current-syntax`, :pep:`318#design-goals`); "
"the only difference is that you're decorating a class instead of a function. "
"The following two snippets are semantically identical::"
