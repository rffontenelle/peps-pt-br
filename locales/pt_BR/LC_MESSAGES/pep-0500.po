"This PEP specifies a new protocol (PDDM - \"A Protocol for Delegating "
"Datetime Methods\") that can be used by concrete implementations of the "
"``datetime.tzinfo`` interface to override aware datetime arithmetics, "
"formatting and parsing.  We describe changes to the ``datetime.datetime``"
" class to support the new protocol and propose a new abstract class "
"``datetime.tzstrict`` that implements parts of this protocol necessary to"
" make aware datetime instances to follow \"strict\" arithmetic rules."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0500.txt:30
msgid ""
"As of Python 3.5, aware datetime instances that share a ``tzinfo`` object"
" follow the rules of arithmetics that are induced by a simple bijection "
"between (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond) 7-tuples "
"and large integers.  In this arithmetics, the difference between "
"YEAR-11-02T12:00 and YEAR-11-01T12:00 is always 24 hours, even though in "
"the US/Eastern timezone, for example, there are 25 hours between "
"2014-11-01T12:00 and 2014-11-02T12:00 because the local clocks were "
"rolled back one hour at 2014-11-02T02:00, introducing an extra hour in "
"the night between 2014-11-01 and 2014-11-02."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0500.txt:41
msgid ""
"Many business applications require the use of Python's simplified view of"
" local dates.  No self-respecting car rental company will charge its "
"customers more for a week that straddles the end of DST than for any "
"other week or require that they return the car an hour early. Therefore, "
"changing the current rules for aware datetime arithmetics will not only "
"create a backward compatibility nightmare, it will eliminate support for "
"legitimate and common use cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0500.txt:49
msgid ""
"Since it is impossible to choose universal rules for local time "
"arithmetics, we propose to delegate implementation of those rules to the "
"classes that implement ``datetime.tzinfo`` interface.  With such "
"delegation in place, users will be able to choose between different "
"arithmetics by simply picking instances of different classes for the "
"value of ``tzinfo``."
