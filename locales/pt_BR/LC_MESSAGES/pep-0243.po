"For a module repository system (such as Perl's CPAN) to be successful, it"
" must be as easy as possible for module authors to submit their work.  An"
" obvious place for this submit to happen is in the Distutils tools after "
"the distribution archive has been successfully created.  For example, "
"after a module author has tested their software (verifying the results of"
" ``setup.py sdist``), they might type ``setup.py sdist --submit``.  This "
"would flag Distutils to submit the source distribution to the archive "
"server for inclusion and distribution to the mirrors."
