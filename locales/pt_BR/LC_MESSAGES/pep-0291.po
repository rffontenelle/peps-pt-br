"This PEP describes the packages and modules in the Python 2 standard library "
"which should remain backward compatible with previous versions of Python.  "
"If a package is not listed here, then it need only remain compatible with "
"the version of Python it is distributed with."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0291.txt:27
msgid ""
"Authors have various reasons why packages and modules should continue to "
"work with previous versions of Python.  In order to maintain backward "
"compatibility for these modules while moving the rest of the standard "
"library forward, it is necessary to know which modules can be modified and "
"which should use old and possibly deprecated features."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0291.txt:34
msgid ""
"Generally, authors should attempt to keep changes backward compatible with "
"the previous released version of Python in order to make bug fixes easier to "
"backport."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0291.txt:38
msgid ""
"In addition to a package or module being listed in this PEP, authors must "
"add a comment at the top of each file documenting the compatibility "
"requirement."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0291.txt:42
msgid ""
"When a major version of Python is released, a Subversion branch is created "
"for continued maintenance and bug fix releases.  A package version on a "
"branch may have a different compatibility requirement than the same package "
"on the trunk (i.e. current bleeding-edge development).  Where appropriate, "
"these branch compatibilities are listed below."
