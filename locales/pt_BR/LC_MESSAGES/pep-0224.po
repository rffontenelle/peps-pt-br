msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:25
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes a small addition to the way Python currently handles "
"docstrings embedded in Python code."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:28
msgid ""
"Python currently only handles the case of docstrings which appear directly "
"after a class definition, a function definition or as first string literal "
"in a module.  The string literals are added to the objects in question under "
"the ``__doc__`` attribute and are from then on available for introspection "
"tools which can extract the contained information for help, debugging and "
"documentation purposes."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:36
msgid ""
"Docstrings appearing in locations other than the ones mentioned are simply "
"ignored and don't result in any code generation."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:39
msgid "Here is an example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:50
msgid ""
"The docstrings (1) and (2) are currently being ignored by the Python byte "
"code compiler, but could obviously be put to good use for documenting the "
"named assignments that precede them."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:54
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes to also make use of these cases by proposing semantics for "
"adding their content to the objects in which they appear under new generated "
"attribute names."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:58
msgid ""
"The original idea behind this approach which also inspired the above example "
"was to enable inline documentation of class attributes, which can currently "
"only be documented in the class's docstring or using comments which are not "
"available for introspection."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:66
msgid "Implementation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:68
msgid ""
"Docstrings are handled by the byte code compiler as expressions. The current "
"implementation special cases the few locations mentioned above to make use "
"of these expressions, but otherwise ignores the strings completely."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:73
msgid ""
"To enable use of these docstrings for documenting named assignments (which "
"is the natural way of defining e.g. class attributes), the compiler will "
"have to keep track of the last assigned name and then use this name to "
"assign the content of the docstring to an attribute of the containing object "
"by means of storing it in as a constant which is then added to the object's "
"namespace during object construction time."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:81
msgid ""
"In order to preserve features like inheritance and hiding of Python's "
"special attributes (ones with leading and trailing double underscores), a "
"special name mangling has to be applied which uniquely identifies the "
"docstring as belonging to the name assignment and allows finding the "
"docstring later on by inspecting the namespace."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:88
msgid "The following name mangling scheme achieves all of the above::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:92
msgid ""
"To keep track of the last assigned name, the byte code compiler stores this "
"name in a variable of the compiling structure.  This variable defaults to "
"NULL.  When it sees a docstring, it then checks the variable and uses the "
"name as basis for the above name mangling to produce an implicit assignment "
"of the docstring to the mangled name.  It then resets the variable to NULL "
"to avoid duplicate assignments."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:100
msgid ""
"If the variable does not point to a name (i.e. is NULL), no assignments are "
"made.  These will continue to be ignored like before.  All classical "
"docstrings fall under this case, so no duplicate assignments are done."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:105
msgid ""
"In the above example this would result in the following new class attributes "
"to be created::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:111
msgid ""
"A patch to the current CVS version of Python 2.0 which implements the above "
"is available on SourceForge at [1]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:116
msgid "Caveats of the Implementation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:118
msgid ""
"Since the implementation does not reset the compiling structure variable "
"when processing a non-expression, e.g. a function definition, the last "
"assigned name remains active until either the next assignment or the next "
"occurrence of a docstring."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:123
msgid ""
"This can lead to cases where the docstring and assignment may be separated "
"by other expressions::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:138
msgid ""
"Since the definition of method \"x\" currently does not reset the used "
"assignment name variable, it is still valid when the compiler reaches the "
"docstring \"b's doc string\" and thus assigns the string to ``__doc_b__``."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:143
msgid ""
"A possible solution to this problem would be resetting the name variable for "
"all non-expression nodes in the compiler."
msgstr ""

msgid "Possible Problems"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:150
msgid ""
"Even though highly unlikely, attribute docstrings could get accidentally "
"concatenated to the attribute's value::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:157
msgid ""
"The trailing slash would cause the Python compiler to concatenate the "
"attribute value and the docstring."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:160
msgid ""
"A modern syntax highlighting editor would easily make this accident visible, "
"though, and by simply inserting empty lines between the attribute definition "
"and the docstring you can avoid the possible concatenation completely, so "
"the problem is negligible."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:166
msgid ""
"Another possible problem is that of using triple quoted strings as a way to "
"uncomment parts of your code."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:169
msgid ""
"If there happens to be an assignment just before the start of the comment "
"string, then the compiler will treat the comment as docstring attribute and "
"apply the above logic to it."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0224.txt:173

"Besides generating a docstring for an otherwise undocumented attribute there "
"is no breakage."
