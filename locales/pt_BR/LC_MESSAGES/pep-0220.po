"Demonstrates why the changes described in the stackless PEP are desirable.  "
"A low-level continuations module exists.  With it, coroutines and generators "
"and \"green\" threads can be written.  A higher level module that makes "
"coroutines and generators easy to create is desirable (and being worked "
"on).  The focus of this PEP is on showing how coroutines, generators, and "
"green threads can simplify common programming problems."
