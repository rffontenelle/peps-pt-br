"This PEP proposes adding % formatting operations similar to Python 2's "
"``str`` type to ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` [1]_ [2]_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0461.txt:24
msgid ""
"While interpolation is usually thought of as a string operation, there are "
"cases where interpolation on ``bytes`` or ``bytearrays`` make sense, and the "
"work needed to make up for this missing functionality detracts from the "
"overall readability of the code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0461.txt:33
msgid ""
"With Python 3 and the split between ``str`` and ``bytes``, one small but "
"important area of programming became slightly more difficult, and much more "
"painful -- wire format protocols [3]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0461.txt:37
#, python-format
msgid ""
"This area of programming is characterized by a mixture of binary data and "
"ASCII compatible segments of text (aka ASCII-encoded text).  Bringing back a "
"restricted %-interpolation for ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` will aid both in "
"writing new wire format code, and in porting Python 2 wire format code."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0461.txt:42
msgid ""
"Common use-cases include ``dbf`` and ``pdf`` file formats, ``email`` "
"formats, and ``FTP`` and ``HTTP`` communications, among many others."

"All the numeric formatting codes (``d``, ``i``, ``o``, ``u``, ``x``, ``X``, "
"``e``, ``E``, ``f``, ``F``, ``g``, ``G``, and any that are subsequently "
"added to Python 3) will be supported, and will work as they do for str, "
"including the padding, justification and other related modifiers (currently "
"``#``, ``0``, ``-``, space, and ``+`` (plus any added to Python 3)).  The "
"only non-numeric codes allowed are ``c``, ``b``, ``a``, and ``s`` (which is "
"a synonym for b)."
msgstr ""

#, python-format

"For the numeric codes, the only difference between ``str`` and ``bytes`` (or "
"``bytearray``) interpolation is that the results from these codes will be "
"ASCII-encoded text, not unicode.  In other words, for any numeric formatting "

"offering %-interpolation that assumes an ASCII encoding will be an "
"attractive nuisance and lead us back to the problems of the Python 2 ``str``/"
"``unicode`` text model"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0461.txt:212
msgid ""
"As was seen during the discussion, ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` are also used "

"``dbf`` and ``pdf``, network protocols such as ``ftp`` and ``email``, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0461.txt:216
#, python-format
msgid ""
"``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` already have several methods which assume an "
"ASCII compatible encoding.  ``upper()``, ``isalpha()``, and ``expandtabs()`` "
"to name just a few.  %-interpolation, with its very restricted mini-"
"language, will not be any more of a nuisance than the already existing "
"methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0461.txt:221

"Some have objected to allowing the full range of numeric formatting codes "
"with the claim that decimal alone would be sufficient.  However, at least "
"two formats (dbf and pdf) make use of non-decimal numbers."
