msgid ""
"This PEP clarifies and updates :pep:`376` (Database of Installed Python "
"Distributions), rewriting it as an interoperability standard. It moves the "
"canonical location of the standard to the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) "
"standards repository, and sets up guidelines for changing it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two files in installed ``.dist-info`` directories are made optional: "
"``RECORD`` (which :pep:`376` lists as mandatory, but suggests it can be left "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0627.rst:34
msgid ""
"Python packaging is moving from relying on specific tools (Setuptools and "
"pip) toward an ecosystem of tools and tool-agnostic interoperability "
"standards."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0627.rst:37
msgid ""
":pep:`376` is not written as an interoperability standard. It describes "
"implementation details of specific tools and libraries, and is "
"underspecified, leaving much room for implementation-defined behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0627.rst:41

"This is a proposal to “distill” the standard from :pep:`376`, clarify it, "

msgid "There is no API to get information on installed distributions."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0627.rst:56
msgid ""
"The new document focuses only the on-disk format of information about "

"The canonical standard for *Recording installed projects* (previously known "

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0627.rst:71

msgid ""
"The PyPA glossary defines “Distribution” (or, “Distribution Package” to "

"All tool- and library-specific details are removed. The mechanisms of how a "

msgid ""
"Both *hash* and *size* fields are now optional (for any file, not just ``."
"pyc``, ``.pyo`` and ``RECORD``). Leavng them out is discouraged, except for "
"``*.pyc`` and ``RECORD`` itself. (Note that :pep:`376` is unclear on what "
"was optional; when taken literally, its text and examples contradict. "
"Despite that, “both fields are optional“ is a reasonable interpretation of :"
"pep:`376`. The alternative would be to mandate—rather than recommend—which "
"files can be recorded without hash and size, and to update that list over "
"time as new use cases come up.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0627.rst:148
msgid ""
"The new spec explicitly says that the ``RECORD`` file must now include *all* "
"files of the installed project (the exception for ``.pyc`` files remains). "
"Since tools use ``RECORD`` for uninstallation, incomplete file lists could "
"introduce orphaned files to users' environments. On the other hand, this "

"list of files is unknown."

msgid ""
"Specifically, the ``RECORD`` file is unnecessary when projects are installed "
"by a Linux system packaging system, which has its own ways to keep track of "
"files, uninstall them or check their integrity. Having to keep a ``RECORD`` "

"This file was originally added to distinguish projects installed by the "
"Python installer (``pip``) from ones installed by other package managers (e."

"Instead of relying on the installer name, tools should use feature "

msgstr ""
