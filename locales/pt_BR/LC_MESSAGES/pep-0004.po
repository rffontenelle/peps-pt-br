"When new modules were added to the standard Python library in the past, it "
"was not possible to foresee whether they would still be useful in the "
"future.  Even though Python \"Comes With Batteries Included\", batteries may "
"discharge over time.  Carrying old modules around is a burden on the "
"maintainer, especially when there is no interest in the module anymore."

"At the same time, removing a module from the distribution is difficult, as "
"it is not known in general whether anybody is still using it.  This PEP "
"defines a procedure for removing modules from the standard Python library.  "
"Usage of a module may be 'deprecated', which means that it may be removed "
"from a future Python release."
