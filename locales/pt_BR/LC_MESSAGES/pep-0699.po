#: ../pep-0699.rst:19
msgid ""
":pep:`509` introduced a private ``ma_version_tag`` field for dictionaries to "
"allow optimizations in CPython and extension libraries. This PEP proposes to "
"rescind :pep:`509` and declare the field an implementation detail, as it has "
"already been superseded by alternatives. This will further allow the field "
"to be reused for future optimization."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:27
msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:29
msgid ""
":pep:`509` introduced the ``ma_version_tag`` field to dictionaries. This 64-"
"bit field stored a version counter that updates every time a dictionary was "
"modified. The original proposal was to use this version counter as a guard "
"for optimizations."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:34
msgid ""
"Since CPython 3.11, this field has become unused by internal optimization "
"efforts. :pep:`659`-specialized instructions use other methods of verifying "
"that certain optimisations are safe."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:38
msgid ""
"To enable further optimizations in CPython, this PEP proposes that the "
"``ma_version_tag`` field no longer conform to the :pep:`509` specification. "
"This will allow the CPython developers to store other optimization "
"information, such as dictionary write watchers."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:45
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:46
msgid ""
"This PEP does not specify what the field may be used for in the future. This "
"is intentional, as implementation details are subject to change, and the "
"field should be used only for internal consumption by CPython."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:52
msgid "Specification"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:54
msgid ""
"This specification rescinds that in :pep:`509`. The ``ma_version_tag`` field "
"of the Python :class:`dict` class is declared to be an internal "
"implementation detail and may be removed altogether, or may have a different "
"representation. C extensions should not rely on this field."
msgstr ""

msgid "Backwards Compatibility"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:63
msgid ""
"Certain extensions use ``ma_version_tag`` for fast dictionary or globals "
"lookups. For example, `Cython uses the field for fast dynamic module "
"variable lookups <https://github.com/cython/cython/"
"blob/169876872f3cb6198971a1db07e5b8a9d12b3dac/Cython/Utility/ObjectHandling."
"c#L1556>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:67
msgid ""
"Since this field is private and makes no guarantees on backwards "
"compatibility, this PEP proposes to repeal :pep:`509` immediately within the "
"next CPython version. A function for fast cached dictionary lookups may be "
"provided as an alternative feature to replace directly accessing "
"``ma_version_tag``."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:72
msgid ""
"The biggest user the author could find for this field was Cython. "
"Discussions with a Cython maintainer indicated that `removing support for it "
"from Cython is trivial <https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/"

msgid "Security Implications"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:80
msgid ""
":pep:`509` was concerned with integer overflow. However, this PEP does not "
"introduce any additional security concerns."

msgid "Rejected Ideas"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0699.rst:87
msgid ""
"A possible alternative is to preserve the field for backwards compatibility. "
"This PEP rejects that alternative as future optimizations will consume more "
"memory, and the field was always considered private and undocumented aside "
"from the PEP, with no backward compatibility guarantees. Dictionaries in "
"Python are commonly used, and any increase in their memory consumption will "
"adversely affect Pythonâ€™s performance."
