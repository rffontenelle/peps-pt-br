msgid ""
"This section discusses reasons why Roundup should be preferred over "
"GitHub Issues and Roundup features that are not available on GitHub "
"Issues."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0595.rst:52
msgid ""
"**Roundup is the status quo.**  Roundup has been an integral part of the "
"CPython workflow for years.  It is a stable product that has been tested "
"and customized to adapt to our needs as the workflow evolved."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0595.rst:57
msgid ""
"It is possible to gradually improve it and avoid the disruption that a "
"switch to a different system would inevitably bring to the workflow."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0595.rst:61
msgid ""
"**Open-source and Python powered.**  Roundup is an open-source project "
"and is written in Python.  By using it and supporting it, we also support"
" the Python ecosystem.  Several features developed for bpo have also been"
" ported to upstream Roundup over the years."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0595.rst:67
msgid ""
"**Fully customizable.**  Roundup can be (and has been) fully customized "
"to fit our needs."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0595.rst:70

"**Finer-grained access control.**  Roundup allows the creation of "

"For example, on the issue page, each field (e.g. title, type, versions, "
"status, linked files and PRs, etc.) have appropriate UI elements (input "
"boxes, dropdowns, tables, etc.) that are easy to set and also provide a "
"convenient way to get info about the issue at a glance.  The number of "
"fields, their values, and the UI element they use is also fully "
"customizable. GitHub only provides labels."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0595.rst:86
msgid ""
"The issue list page presents the issues in a compact and easy to read "

"and the sorting and grouping (up to two levels)."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0595.rst:323
msgid ""
"**Vendor lock-in.**  GitHub is proprietary and there is risk of vendor "

"**Required bpo updates.**  bpo will need to be updated in order to add a "
"button that, once pressed, creates a new issue on GitHub, copies over all"
" the messages, attachments, and creates/adds labels for the existing "
"fields.  Permissions will also need to be tweaked to make individual "
"issues read-only once they are migrated, and to prevent users to create "
"new accounts.  It might be necessary to set up redirects (see below)."
msgstr ""

"**Lossy conversion.**  GitHub only mechanism to add custom metadata is "

" ``#4321``, a reference to ``#1234`` in a migrated message could link to "
"bpo ``#1234`` and bpo can redirect to GitHub issue ``#4321``, but new "
