msgid ""
"This PEP introduces generator expressions as a high performance, memory "
"efficient generalization of list comprehensions :pep:`202` and generators"
" :pep:`255`."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:21
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:23
msgid ""
"Experience with list comprehensions has shown their widespread utility "
"throughout Python.  However, many of the use cases do not need to have a "
"full list created in memory.  Instead, they only need to iterate over the"
" elements one at a time."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:28
msgid ""
"For instance, the following summation code will build a full list of "
"squares in memory, iterate over those values, and, when the reference is "
"no longer needed, delete the list::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:34
msgid "Memory is conserved by using a generator expression instead::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:38
msgid "Similar benefits are conferred on constructors for container objects::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:43
msgid ""
"Generator expressions are especially useful with functions like sum(), "
"min(), and max() that reduce an iterable input to a single value::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:48
msgid ""
"Generator expressions also address some examples of functionals coded "
"with lambda::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:54
msgid "These simplify to::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:59
msgid ""
"List comprehensions greatly reduced the need for filter() and map(). "
"Likewise, generator expressions are expected to minimize the need for "
"itertools.ifilter() and itertools.imap().  In contrast, the utility of "
"other itertools will be enhanced by generator expressions::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:66
msgid ""
"Having a syntax similar to list comprehensions also makes it easy to "
"convert existing code into a generator expression when scaling up "
"application."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:70
msgid ""
"Early timings showed that generators had a significant performance "
"advantage over list comprehensions.  However, the latter were highly "
"optimized for Py2.4 and now the performance is roughly comparable for "
"small to mid-sized data sets.  As the data volumes grow larger, generator"
" expressions tend to perform better because they do not exhaust cache "
"memory and they allow Python to re-use objects between iterations."

"(None of this is exact enough in the eye of a reader from Mars, but I "
"hope the examples convey the intention well enough for a discussion in "
"c.l.py.  The Python Reference Manual should contain a 100% exact semantic"
" and syntactic specification.)"

"The semantics of a generator expression are equivalent to creating an "
"anonymous generator function and calling it.  For example::"

msgid ""
"Only the outermost for-expression is evaluated immediately, the other "
"expressions are deferred until the generator is run::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:123
msgid ""
"The syntax requires that a generator expression always needs to be "
"directly inside a set of parentheses and cannot have a comma on either "
"side.  With reference to the file Grammar/Grammar in CVS, two rules "
"change:"

msgid ""
"i.e. if a function call has a single positional argument, it can be a "
"generator expression without extra parentheses, but in all other cases "
"you have to parenthesize it."

msgid ""
"The loop variable (if it is a simple variable or a tuple of simple "
"variables) is not exposed to the surrounding function.  This facilitates "
"the implementation and makes typical use cases more reliable.  In some "
"future version of Python, list comprehensions will also hide the "
"induction variable from the surrounding code (and, in Py2.4, warnings "
"will be issued for code accessing the induction variable)."

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:199
msgid ""
"List comprehensions also \"leak\" their loop variable into the "
"surrounding scope.  This will also change in Python 3.0, so that the "
"semantic definition of a list comprehension in Python 3.0 will be "
"equivalent to list(<generator expression>).  Python 2.4 and beyond should"
" issue a deprecation warning if a list comprehension's loop variable has "
"the same name as a variable used in the immediately surrounding scope."

msgid "Early Binding versus Late Binding"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:210
msgid ""
"After much discussion, it was decided that the first (outermost) for-"
"expression should be evaluated immediately and that the remaining "
"expressions be evaluated when the generator is executed."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:214
msgid ""
"Asked to summarize the reasoning for binding the first expression, Guido "
"offered [1]_::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:231
msgid ""
"Various use cases were proposed for binding all free variables when the "
"generator is defined.  And some proponents felt that the resulting "
"expressions would be easier to understand and debug if bound immediately."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:235
msgid ""
"However, Python takes a late binding approach to lambda expressions and "
"has no precedent for automatic, early binding.  It was felt that "
"introducing a new paradigm would unnecessarily introduce complexity."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:239
msgid ""
"After exploring many possibilities, a consensus emerged that binding "
"issues were hard to understand and that users should be strongly "
"encouraged to use generator expressions inside functions that consume "
"their arguments immediately.  For more complex applications, full "
"generator definitions are always superior in terms of being obvious about"
" scope, lifetime, and binding [2]_."

msgid "Reduction Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0289.txt:250
msgid ""
"The utility of generator expressions is greatly enhanced when combined "
"with reduction functions like sum(), min(), and max().  The heapq module "
"in Python 2.4 includes two new reduction functions: nlargest() and "
"nsmallest().  Both work well with generator expressions and keep no more "
"than n items in memory at one time."
