"This PEP describes the often proposed feature of exposing the loop counter "
"in for-loops.  This PEP tracks the status and ownership of this feature.  It "
"contains a description of the feature and outlines changes necessary to "
"support the feature.  This PEP summarizes discussions held in mailing list "
"forums, and provides URLs for further information, where appropriate.  The "
"CVS revision history of this file contains the definitive historical record."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0212.txt:35
msgid ""
"Standard for-loops in Python iterate over the elements of a sequence [1]_.  "
"Often it is desirable to loop over the indices or both the elements and the "
"indices instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0212.txt:39
msgid ""
"The common idioms used to accomplish this are unintuitive.  This PEP "
"proposes two different ways of exposing the indices."

"The current idiom for looping over the indices makes use of the built-in "
"``range`` function::"

"Looping over both elements and indices can be achieved either by the old "
"idiom or by using the new ``zip`` built-in function [2]_::"

msgid "The Proposed Solutions"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0212.txt:68
msgid ""
"There are three solutions that have been discussed.  One adds a non-reserved "
"keyword, the other adds two built-in functions. A third solution adds "
"methods to sequence objects."

msgid "Non-reserved keyword ``indexing``"

#: ../pep-0212.txt:76

"This solution would extend the syntax of the for-loop by adding an optional "
"``<variable> indexing`` clause which can also be used instead of the "
"``<variable> in`` clause."

"This solution adds two built-in functions ``indices`` and ``irange``. The "
"semantics of these can be described as follows::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0212.txt:103
msgid ""
"These functions could be implemented either eagerly or lazily and should be "
"easy to extend in order to accept more than one sequence argument."

"The use of these functions would simplify the idioms for looping over the "
"indices and over both elements and indices::"

msgid "Methods for sequence objects"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0212.txt:120
msgid ""
"This solution proposes the addition of ``indices``, ``items`` and ``values`` "
"methods to sequences, which enable looping over indices only, both indices "
"and elements, and elements only respectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0212.txt:125
msgid ""
"This would immensely simplify the idioms for looping over indices and for "
"looping over both elements and indices::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0212.txt:134
msgid ""
"Additionally it would allow to do looping over the elements of sequences and "
"dictionaries in a consistent way::"
