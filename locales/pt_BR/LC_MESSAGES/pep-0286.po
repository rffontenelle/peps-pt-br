"Further exploration of the concepts covered in this PEP has been deferred"

"PEP and collecting and incorporating feedback, and with sufficient "
"available time to do so effectively."

msgid "Problem description"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0286.txt:36
msgid ""
"Today, argument tuples keep references to the function arguments, which "
"are guaranteed to live as long as the argument tuple exists which is at "
"least as long as the function call is being executed."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0286.txt:40
msgid ""
"In some cases, parsing an argument will allocate new memory, which is "
"then to be released by the caller.  This has two problems:"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0286.txt:43
msgid ""
"In case of failure, the application cannot know what memory to release; "
"most callers don't even know that they have the responsibility to release"
" that memory.  Example for this are the ``N`` converter (bug #416288 "
"[1]_) and the ``es#`` converter (bug #501716 [2]_)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0286.txt:49
msgid ""
"Even for successful argument parsing, it is still inconvenient for the "
"caller to be responsible for releasing the memory.  In some cases, this "
"is unnecessarily inefficient.  For example, the ``es`` converter copies "
"the conversion result into memory, even though there already is a string "
"object that has the right contents."

msgid ""
"A new type 'argument tuple' is introduced.  This type derives from tuple,"
" adding an ``__dict__`` member (at ``tp_dictoffset`` -4).  Instances of "
"this type might get the following attributes:"

"tuple is released"

"When argument parsing fails, all fail objects will be released through "

"``E*`` converters is identical to that of the ``e*`` converters, except "
"that the application will not need to manage the resulting memory. This "
"will be implemented through registration of Ok objects with the argument "
