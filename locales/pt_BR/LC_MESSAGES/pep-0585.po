"Static typing as defined by PEPs 484, 526, 544, 560, and 563 was built "

"Usefulness of this syntax before :pep:`585` is limited as external "

" putting types outside of annotations, in runtime context.  While these "
"are relatively less common than type annotations, it's important to allow"
" using the same type syntax in all contexts.  This is why starting with "
"Python 3.9, the following collections become generic using "
