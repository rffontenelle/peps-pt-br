"Python provides six binary infix math operators: ``+`` ``-`` ``*`` ``/`` "
"``%`` ``**`` hereafter generically represented by ``op``.  They can be "
"overloaded with new semantics for user-defined classes.  However, for "
"objects composed of homogeneous elements, such as arrays, vectors and "
"matrices in numerical computation, there are two essentially distinct "
"flavors of semantics.  The objectwise operations treat these objects as "
"points in multidimensional spaces. The elementwise operations treat them "
"as collections of individual elements. These two flavors of operations "
"are often intermixed in the same formulas, thereby requiring syntactical "
"distinction."
