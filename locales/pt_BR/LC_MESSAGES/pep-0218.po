"This PEP proposes adding a Set module to the standard Python library, and"
" to then make sets a built-in Python type if that module is widely used."
"  After explaining why sets are desirable, and why the common idiom of "
"using dictionaries in their place is inadequate, we describe how we "
"intend built-in sets to work, and then how the preliminary Set module "
"will behave.  The last section discusses the mutability (or otherwise) of"
" sets and set elements, and the solution which the Set module will "
"implement."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:28
msgid ""
"Sets are a fundamental mathematical structure, and are very commonly used"
" in algorithm specifications.  They are much less frequently used in "
"implementations, even when they are the \"right\" structure.  Programmers"
" frequently use lists instead, even when the ordering information in "
"lists is irrelevant, and by-value lookups are frequent.  (Most medium-"
"sized C programs contain a depressing number of start-to-end searches "
"through malloc'd vectors to determine whether particular items are "
"present or not...)"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:38
msgid ""
"Programmers are often told that they can implement sets as dictionaries "
"with \"don't care\" values.  Items can be added to these \"sets\" by "
"assigning the \"don't care\" value to them; membership can be tested "
"using ``dict.has_key``; and items can be deleted using ``del``.  However,"
" the other main operations on sets (union, intersection, and difference) "
"are not directly supported by this representation, since their meaning is"
" ambiguous for dictionaries containing key/value pairs."

"We propose using the bitwise operators \"``|&``\" for intersection and "
"union.  While \"``+``\" for union would be intuitive, \"``*``\" for "
"intersection is not (very few of the people asked guessed what it did "
"correctly)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:123
msgid ""
"We considered using \"``+``\" to add elements to a set, rather than "
"\"add\".  However, Guido van Rossum pointed out that \"``+``\" is "
"symmetric for other built-in types (although \"``*``\" is not).  Use of "
"\"add\" will also avoid confusion between that operation and set union."

msgid "Set Notation"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:133
msgid ""
"The PEP originally proposed ``{1,2,3}`` as the set notation and ``{-}`` "
"for the empty set.  Experience with Python 2.3's ``sets.py`` showed that "
"the notation was not necessary.  Also, there was some risk of making "
"dictionaries less instantly recognizable."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:138
msgid ""
"It was also contemplated that the braced notation would support set "
"comprehensions; however, Python 2.4 provided generator expressions which "
"fully met that need and did so it a more general way. (See :pep:`289` for"
" details on generator expressions)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:143

"So, Guido ruled that there would not be a set syntax; however, the issue "

"To gain experience with sets, a pure python module was introduced in "
"Python 2.3.  Based on that implementation, the set and frozenset types "
"were introduced in Python 2.4.  The improvements are:"

msgid "Better hash algorithm for frozensets"

#: ../pep-0218.txt:155

"More compact pickle format (storing only an element list instead of a "
"dictionary of key:value pairs where the value is always ``True``)."

msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:162

"The ``_repr`` method was dropped (the need is met by the new ``sorted()``"
" built-in function)."

"Tim Peters believes that the class's constructor should take a single "
"sequence as an argument, and populate the set with that sequence's "
"elements.  His argument is that in most cases, programmers will be "
"creating sets from pre-existing sequences, so that this case should be "
"the common one.  However, this would require users to remember an extra "
"set of parentheses when initializing a set with known values::"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:175
msgid ""
"On the other hand, feedback from a small number of novice Python users "
"(all of whom were very experienced with other languages) indicates that "
"people will find a \"parenthesis-free\" syntax more natural::"

"Ultimately, we adopted the first strategy in which the initializer takes "
"a single iterable argument."

msgid "Mutability"
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:189
msgid ""
"The most difficult question to resolve in this proposal was whether sets "
"ought to be able to contain mutable elements.  A dictionary's keys must "
"be immutable in order to support fast, reliable lookup.  While it would "
"be easy to require set elements to be immutable, this would preclude sets"
" of sets (which are widely used in graph algorithms and other "
"applications)."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:196
msgid ""
"Earlier drafts of :pep:`218` had only a single set type, but the "
"``sets.py`` implementation in Python 2.3 has two, Set and ImmutableSet.  "
"For Python 2.4, the new built-in types were named ``set`` and "
"``frozenset`` which are slightly less cumbersome."
msgstr ""

#: ../pep-0218.txt:201
msgid ""
"There are two classes implemented in the \"sets\" module.  Instances of "
"the Set class can be modified by the addition or removal of elements, and"
" the ImmutableSet class is \"frozen\", with an unchangeable collection of"
" elements.  Therefore, an ImmutableSet may be used as a dictionary key or"
" as a set element, but cannot be updated.  Both types of set require that"
" their elements are immutable, hashable objects.  Parallel comments apply"
" to the \"set\" and \"frozenset\" built-in types."
