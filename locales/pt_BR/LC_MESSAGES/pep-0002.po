"The Python Standard Library contributes significantly to Python's success.  "
"The language comes with \"batteries included\", so it is easy for people to "
"become productive with just the standard library alone. It is therefore "
"important that the usefulness of the standard library be maintained."

#: ../pep-0002.txt:23
msgid ""
"Due to the visibility and importance of the standard library, it must be "
"maintained thoughtfully. As such, any code within it must be maintained by "
"Python's development team which leads to a perpetual cost to each addition "
"made. There is also added cognitive load for users in familiarizing "
"themselves with what is in the standard library to be considered."

"New functionality is commonly added to the library in the form of new "
"modules. This PEP will describe the procedure for the *addition* of new "
"modules.  :pep:`4` deals with procedures for deprecation of modules; the "
"*removal* of old and unused modules from the standard library."

"members of the development team may choose to maintain a backport of a "
"module outside of the standard library, it is up to them to keep their "
"external code in sync as appropriate."
